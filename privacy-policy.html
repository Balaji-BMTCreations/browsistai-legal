        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chat History:</strong> Your conversations with AI models (stored locally in encrypted Room database on your device, optionally synced to MongoDB cloud servers with your consent)</li>
            <li><strong>Browsing Activity:</strong> URLs visited within the app browser, web search queries</li>

            <li><strong>IP Address & Location Data (PRO/PREMIUM only):</strong> When you use Research Mode (available only with PRO or PREMIUM subscription), we automatically collect your IP address to determine your approximate location (country and city) for providing geographically relevant search results. This helps deliver localized content such as regional news, nearby businesses, and location-appropriate search results. IP-based location data is cached temporarily (24 hours) for performance optimization and is not permanently stored in our database.</li>

        </ul>
